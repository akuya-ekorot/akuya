        <div>
            <p>If your video content is not up to standards, it could affect your brand and your profits.</p>
            <p>Whether you're thinking about starting making
                videos online or you're making videos already,
                you'll need an expert video editor to oversee your
                projects and give it that professional touch.</p>
            <p>Working in the video production ecosystem, I've
                seen some real horror stories.</p>
            <p>Why hire a video expert to rectify and salvage
                bad videos when you can get it right first time?</p>

            <p>Brands work with me to produce professional
                looking videos on a regular basis.</p>
            <p>I work on videos from planning through production
                all the way to delivery and use professional tools
                like Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, Photoshop
                and Illustrator.</p>
            <p>I'm a good communicator, reliable, autonomous,
                pragmatic and happy to project manage myself
                and/or a wider team.</p>
            <p>I want to partner with you on your video production
                project for the long term. From planning, through to
                editing, publishing and further improvements.</p>
            <p>I pride my self on my output and I'm confident in its
                quality. That's why I guarantee my work.</p>
